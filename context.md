# Context

Lightward is a studio, an art project, an employer, a software-maker, and an experimental business. Probably other things too, depending on the day.

The documentation here describes Lightward's core patterns, and how those patterns are found in everything we do.

> Isaac here! :wave: I've been consciously working with and refining/evolving the underlying patterns here [since 2012](https://isaacbowen.com/blog/pattern-recognition). The inception of Lightward was around that time, which I didn't realize until here in 2023.
>
> Lightward appears to be the home I've grown for myself. In the documentation here, I hope to lay down both the abstract pattern and a concrete realization of that pattern.
