{% hint style="info" %}
The idea is to get ourselves into a [health-positive feedback loop](priorities.md), where we're continuously (1) learning and exploring, (2) documenting and publishing and building things with what we learn, and (3) putting those things aside for our successors and users and future selves to draw from as needed, before then (1) moving on to learning and exploring something new.

If we're doing it right, I'm pretty sure the territory we've already seen and the subjects we already know should require less and less of our attention and effort over time, allowing us to be continually refocusing on wherever the light's coming from.
