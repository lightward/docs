# Publishing: Erring public

When you create information (maybe while [playing the product game](product/)), put the results in as public a place as possible.

{% hint style="success" %}
More-public is better than less-public, [unless it's at the expense of health](priorities.md).

The more publicly-accessible a thing is, the greater the odds of someone else incorporating it into what _they're_ building.

It's like open-source software: the more people building a healthy home for themselves using open-source code, the more the code itself can be evolved into something that is itself healthier and more capable.

Same deal here: as we share what we make as we work on our health, and as others incorporate it into what _they_ make as _they_ work on their health, the more stable and healthy the whole network becomes.
{% endhint %}

When evaluating where to publish, run through this list and aim for the _first_ viable audience scope:

1. **Audience: The public internet**
   * GitBook documentation
     * Here, at [lightward.guide](https://www.lightward.guide/)
     * App-specific documentation ([locksmith.guide](https://www.locksmith.guide/), [learn.mechanic.dev](https://learn.mechanic.dev/))
   * The product itself (i.e. make the need for documentation moot by extending/evolving/improving the actual product)
2. **Audience: The internal Lightward team**
   * GitBook documentation: [private.lightward.guide](https://private.lightward.guide/)
   * Slack
   * GitHub
   * 1Password in a shared vault
3. **Audience: Just you** :heart:
   * Notes, Keep, 1Password (in a private vault), or whatever delights you

{% hint style="info" %}
This is an exact inversion of [our overall priorities list](priorities.md). That is not an accident. Public publishing benefits the world, our team, and you; internal publishing benefits our team and you; and if you don't publish it at all, _no one_ but you benefits. (Not directly, anyway! Private information can improve your health, and [that benefits everyone](priorities.md).)
{% endhint %}
