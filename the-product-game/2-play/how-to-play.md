# How to play

Gameplay is different every time. This is an open-world adventure. Your playstyle is your own. Do as you will.

## Hints

* Remember that the score is kept only by your own health -- [the customer's health is not your job](the-customers-health-is-not-your-job.md).
* [Don't sign up for custom work.](no-custom-work.md)
* There's no finish line, and there's no timer. Stay aware, and [choose when to stop](when-to-stop.md).
* If your memory is flaky (mine is -Isaac), keep notes as you go. [Save often](../3-save/).
* Don't bog the customer down with the fine details of your gameplay; they won't be relevant, because the customer's in-game character is their business. Remember: your in-game character is our product.
* Avoid gameplay paths that involve creating secrets. ([Err public.](../../publishing-erring-public.md))
* Avoid gameplay paths that depend uniquely on you. Try not to require yourself to remember to do something later. Be over-the-top generous and kind and accommodating with your future self as possible; when you arrive at that future, your health will thank you, and _everyone_ will benefit as a result.
