# When to stop

Stop whenever you want. Honest. As long as you save your game properly, you can stop whenever you want.

If you have trouble figuring out when to stop, consider:

* **Stop when the next step would require **_**struggle**_
  * The quality of the game suffers if you're not enjoying it. Remember, it's a game, not punishment.
* **Stop if you have to go do something else instead**
  * Many other things in your life are probably more important than this game.
