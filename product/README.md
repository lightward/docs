# Product: Playing the game

Our apps are products. The documentation is also a product.

Running a product is a game, and the game is about building the health of the product in response to incoming stimuli.

{% hint style="info" %}
What else can be considered a "product", in the way that term is used here?
{% endhint %}

Imagine our products as members of Lightward themselves. Locksmith and Mechanic and their respective documentation â€“ [they all have the same priorities as you do](../priorities.md). The only difference is, they're not autonomous. They need you to help them make good on those priorities.

That's the game. You're playing _as_ the product, and your goal is just to be healthy, respecting the [priorities](../priorities.md) of those three tiers of health.

## How to play

1. [**Load the game**](1-load.md) by seeking out all relevant context, everything that previous players have saved for you to use.
2. [**Play the game**](2-play/) like only you can. In this moment, you are the protagonist.
3. [**Save your game**](3-save/), such that someone else can seamlessly pick it up and continue gameplay later from where you left off.
