1: A person can only be sustainably responsible for what they can practically know and understand. (It'd be nonsensically cruel to hold someone responsible for anything else.)

2: A person can only know and understand the things that they can hold, that they're close enough to feel in detail. ([Health](../../priorities.md) can only be defined and addressed by the agent experiencing it.)

**3: We are not our customers.**

2: We're not close enough to the customer to genuinely _feel_ their health. We can get a taste of it, the general vibe of it, but we're not _in it_ with them. We can't define and address their health.

**This is neither invitation nor license to not care.**

The [crowning health priority](../../priorities.md) is about the relationship between Lightward and the world - and the world includes our customers. If a customer is in trouble with our products, we are absolutely on the hook to assess and respond. A healthy relationship between Lightward and its customers is one in which we are actively holding and _feeling_ (in detail!) that relationship.
